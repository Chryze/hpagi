# HPAGI - High Performance Artificial General Intelligence
HPAGI is a theory about an universal reinforcement learning agent.
The theory is based on an approximation of MCTS and combinations of (Hidden) Markov Model, Hopfield,
Bayesian Networks, different Deep learning algorithms and own algorithms.

###The project is not even complete and the theory is not complete implemented!
